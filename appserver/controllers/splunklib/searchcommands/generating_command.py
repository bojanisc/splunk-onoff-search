class GeneratingCommand(SearchCommand):
    """ Generates events based on command arguments.

    Generating commands receive no input and must be the first command on a
    pipeline. By default Splunk will run your command locally on a search head:

    :<source lang=python>@Configuration()</source>

    You can change the default behavior by configuring your generating command
    for event streaming:

    :<source lang=python>@Configuration(streaming=True)</source>

    Splunk will then run your command locally on a search head and/or remotely
    on one or more indexers.

    You can tell Splunk to run your streaming-enabled generating command locally
    on a search head, never remotely on indexers:

    :<source lang=python>@Configuration(local=True, streaming=True)</source>

    If your generating command produces event records in time order, you must
    tell Splunk to ensure correct behavior:

    :<source lang=python>@Configuration(generates_timeorder=True)</source>
